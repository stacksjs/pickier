See the individual files for details on each configuration option.

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not loading?
- Make sure you're in the Extension Development Host window
- Check the Debug Console for errors
- Try restarting the extension (Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window")

### No issues showing?
- Make sure Pickier is enabled in settings
- Check that the file is saved
- Verify the file is TypeScript/JavaScript

### CodeLens not appearing?
- Check setting: `pickier.codeLens.enable` should be `true`
- Try reloading the window
- Ensure file has issues or is clean (CodeLens shows in both cases)

### Hover not working?
- Hover directly over the underlined code
- Wait a moment for tooltip to appear
- Check that there are diagnostics for that line

## Configuration

You can customize extension behavior in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "pickier.enable": true,
  "pickier.run": "onSave",
  "pickier.codeLens.enable": true,
  "pickier.packageManager": "auto"
}
```

See `package.json` in the extension root for all available settings.

## Feedback

After testing, consider:
- Which features are most useful?
- Are there any missing features?
- Is the help text clear and actionable?
- Are the code actions discoverable?
- Is the CodeLens helpful or distracting?

## Next Steps

After testing these examples:

1. Try the extension on your real codebase
2. Customize Pickier config (`pickier.config.ts`) for your needs
3. Report any issues or suggestions
4. Enjoy fast, helpful linting!
