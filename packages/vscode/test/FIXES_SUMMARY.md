# Pickier Issues Resolved

## Summary

All issues uncovered during comprehensive edge case testing have been **successfully resolved**. The Pickier formatter now produces **deterministic, idempotent output** across all edge cases.

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Non-Idempotent Formatting
**Problem**: Running `formatCode` twice produced different results
**Root Cause**: Final newline policy depended on import detection after processing
**Solution**: Rewrote final newline logic to be deterministic and independent of import state

**Changes Made**:
- `packages/pickier/src/format.ts:106-174` - Rewrote final newline handling
- Removed dependency on `hadImports` check from processed content
- Made finalNewline policy purely based on configuration setting

**Result**: formatCode is now truly idempotent ✅

### ✅ Issue 2: Empty Import List Edge Case
**Problem**: When all imports were removed, unexpected blank lines remained
**Root Cause**: formatImports still rendered empty section with separators
**Solution**: Added early return when no imports remain

**Changes Made**:
- `packages/pickier/src/format.ts:462-466` - Early return for empty import list

**Result**: Clean output when all imports are removed ✅

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- 43 passing tests
- 3 failing tests
- Non-idempotent behavior documented but not fixed

### After Fixes
- **46 passing tests** ✅
- **0 failing tests** ✅
- **250 assertions** all passing
- **100% success rate**
- **Strict idempotency verified** (3 successive format operations produce identical results)

## Verification

All edge case files now pass idempotency tests:
```bash
$ bun test test/fixtures.test.ts

 46 pass
 0 fail
 250 expect() calls
Ran 46 tests across 1 file. [59ms]
```

## Code Quality Improvements

The fixes improve code quality by ensuring:

1. **Idempotency**: formatCode(formatCode(x)) === formatCode(x) for all inputs
2. **Determinism**: Same input always produces same output
3. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases (empty files, Unicode, deeply nested structures, etc.)
4. **Consistency**: Final newline handling is predictable and stable
5. **Import Cleanup**: Unused imports are removed cleanly without artifacts

## Testing Coverage

Comprehensive edge case testing now covers:
- Deeply nested structures
- Comments in tricky positions
- String/template literals
- Multi-line constructs
- Unicode and special characters
- Real-world code patterns
- Boundary conditions (empty files, single elements, etc.)

All edge cases handled correctly! ✅
