# Globbing & Ignores

Accurate and fast scanning is essential for performance. Pickier uses `fast-glob`and applies a consistent path expansion strategy, then filters by extensions.

## Path expansion

- If a provided argument contains glob magic (e.g.,`*`, `{}`, `[]`, `?`), it is passed through as-is
- If it looks like a file path with an extension, it is used as-is (lint only)
- Otherwise, it is treated as a directory and expanded to `dir/**/*`Note: The formatter expands directories to`**/*`unconditionally for non-glob inputs; the linter uses a slightly smarter check to leave explicit file paths untouched.

## Extension filtering

After expansion, matched files are filtered by extensions:

- CLI default for`--ext`is`.ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx`- If`--ext`is omitted, Pickier uses the config’s`format.extensions`or`lint.extensions`- In config, extensions are specified without dots (e.g.,`'ts'`, not `'.ts'`)

Examples:

```bash
pickier format . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js
pickier lint "src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js}" --max-warnings 0
```## Ignores

Ignored paths come from`config.ignores`. Defaults include common folders like `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `vendor`, and `coverage`.

Examples:

```ts
export default {
  ignores: ['**/node_modules/**', '**/dist/**', '**/coverage/**'],
}
```Currently, the`--ignore-path`CLI flag is accepted but not applied; prefer configuring`ignores`in your config file.

## fast-glob options

Pickier calls`fast-glob`with these options:

-`dot: false`— skip dotfiles by default
-`ignore: config.ignores`-`onlyFiles: true`-`unique: true`-`absolute: true`## Best practices

- Keep`ignores`broad at the top-level to save I/O (e.g.,`**/coverage/**`)
- Pass explicit globs in local workflows for the changed area to save time
- Remember to include `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml` if you want formatting coverage beyond TS/JS
