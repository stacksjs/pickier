# Advanced Topics

Dive deeper into configuration, plugins, and large-repo workflows.

- [Plugin system](/advanced/plugin-system): Author and configure custom rules via the Pickier plugin API.
- [Configuration deep dive](/advanced/configuration-deep-dive): All config knobs, merging behavior, and defaults.
- [Globbing and ignores](/advanced/globbing-and-ignores): Precise control over what files are scanned.
- [CI](/advanced/ci): Fast and reliable checks in pipelines.

These topics build on the core APIs (`runFormat`, `runLint`) and types exported from the library.
