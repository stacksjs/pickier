# regexp/noUnusedCapturingGroup

Flags regex literals that contain capturing groups but no corresponding backreferences. This rule is heuristic and may produce false positives.

- Category: Core (optional)
- Default: off

Config:

```ts
rules: { noUnusedCapturingGroup: 'warn' } // 'off' | 'warn' | 'error'
```Example:```ts

const r = /(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/
// no backreference usage detected

```Rationale: unused capturing groups can be converted to non-capturing`(?:...)`for performance/readability.

## Suggested fix

Replace unused`()`with`(?:...)`:

```ts

const r = /\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}/

```## Best practices

- Name only the groups you need to reference; prefer non-capturing groups otherwise
- Consider`?:` for grouping without capture to reduce backreference complexity
- Keep complex regexes commented or broken into smaller parts for maintainability
