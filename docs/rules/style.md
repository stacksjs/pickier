# style (built-in plugin)

Rules provided by the built-in `style` plugin.

- [`max-statements-per-line`](/rules/style-max-statements-per-line): limit the number of statements allowed on a single line

See the [Plugin System](/advanced/plugin-system) for configuration examples.

## Best practices

- Use style rules to complement formatting where structure matters (e.g., discourage dense one-liners)
- Tune per-folder if different code areas have unique style constraints (scripts vs. libraries)
